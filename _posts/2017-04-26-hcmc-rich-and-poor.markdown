#### Ho Chi Minh city is a city of extremes

A one-room dwelling in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam’s capital (formerly Saigon), can cost you anywhere between €8 and over €1,000. Such inequalities are extreme in the metropolis of 8 million, but official measures of inequality made by the World Bank [put](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?end=2014&start=2014&view=map) Vietnam close to average, 15% more unequal than Austria and 40% less unequal than Brazil.

Whatever statistics made in Washington might say, a large portion of the inhabitants of Ho Chi Minh live in precarious conditions. Only one in ten migrant workers has signed a work contract, which is needed to rent a decent home. Migrant workers make up 30% of the total population. Many newcomers are searching for a job and a better life. “My wife, my son and I altogether were making €160 to €200 per month back home from selling groceries” says a construction worker, coming from Bạc Liêu, a Southern province of Vietnam some 200 kilometres away from Ho Chi Minh. “Life is much better here because we have money”. He is living with his family in a 6 square meters shack and pays €80 on monthly rent. 

As many others, the family could not afford to rent a home on the formal housing market, where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom flat can be as high as €490. In such conditions, people earning the official minimum wage of [€135 a month](http://www.thanhniennews.com/society/vietnams-minimum-wage-to-increase-1418-per-month-in-2015-29590.html) cannot hope to rent on the formal market. Even university graduates, with an average income of €350 per month, must live in overcrowded homes.

Overcrowded apartments are a major issue. One in three households in Ho Chi Minh live in homes with less than 7 square metres per person. This means that about 6 people live in a 40-square meter flat, what is considered in Europe a one or two-person dwelling. For migrant workers, the situation is ever more precarious: Two in three migrant households live with less than 7 sqm per person. In Europe, 20 square meters per person is considered very little.

The utter poverty of many dwellers of Ho Chi Minh does not prevent gentrification. In trendy neighborhoods, rents prices are rising, and rapidly. “Rents prices around me increased threefold in one year”, says Mai, the owner of a hairdresser salon. Recent changes in legislation allowed for foreigners - many of them speculators - to buy property in Vietnam. While this might be the cause of the recent sky-high increases, analysts [dispute](http://www.thanhniennews.com/business/allowing-foreigners-to-buy-houses-to-have-no-big-impact-on-market-for-a-while-analyst-47355.html) this claim. The first Starbucks opened in 2013 in District 1, the most central one, shortly followed by 16 other franchises of the company. Co-working spaces are now offering iced cappuccinos with prices [ranging](https://www.theblondtravels.com/cafes-to-work-from-in-ho-chi-minh-city/) from one to four euros, which is the daily salary of a worker on minimum wage. 

New, high-end neighborhoods are created from scratch on underdeveloped areas close to the city center. The [Thu Thiem](http://saigoneer.com/saigon-development/5406-construction-kicks-off-on-the-crown-jewel-of-thu-thiem) “Crown of Jewels” project exemplifies this trend. 660 hectares (about five times the area of Schönbrunn Gardens in Vienna or the size of the 19th arrondissement of Paris) of former marshland opposite to the historical center will be transformed in a new neighborhood with shops, facilities and high rise buildings nested in eco-neighborhoods that clearly targets [high-income locals and immigrants from rich countries](http://luxuryproperty.com.vn/project/sala-thu-thiem-new-urban-area-ho-chi-minh-city/).

The Thu Thiem development pushed [14,000 households](https://culanth.org/articles/577-eviction-time-in-the-new-saigon-temporalities-of) away from the city center since 2002. It shows the consequences of the internationalization and economic growth of the city center.
