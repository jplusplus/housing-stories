#### Large urban renewal projects in Ho Chi Minh displace thousands

Ho Chi Minh City, the economic capital of Vietnam (formerly Saigon), saw its population increase by a whopping 70% in the last 20 years. Migration from rural to urban areas of the country, triggered by vibrant economic growth, is not unheard of. Many of Europe’s biggest cities witnessed similar increases in population at the end of the 19th century in Europe. The analogy holds to a point. While European cities doubled in size from one to two million or less, Ho Chi Minh grew from less than 5 to over 8 million people. To cope with the change, the city developed titanic building programs that displaced thousands.

The inadequacy between the organic growth of the city and urban planning by the administration led to an uncontrolled urban sprawl. Industrial zones are being created on the outskirt of Ho Chi Minh without any consideration for the available housing nearby. Responding to the demand, [informal boarding houses](http://www.michael-waibel.de/papers/2007_ASIEN_103_Waibel_Paper_Cover.pdf) have spread close to factories and construction sites to host workers. Habitat for Humanity, an American non-governmental organization, estimates that two million people in Ho Chi Minh (one in four inhabitants) live is these boarding houses, unable to afford an apartment on the housing market.

Informal housing is not limited to renting. Construction can also be made informally, leading to Kafkaesque situations. According to UN-Habitat, an agency part of the United Nations, three in four apartments in Vietnam cities are self-built, a vast majority of them informally. Houses are build in one night by families on bricks foundations and with metal roofs, to avoid being caught by authorities. They are then sold by word of mouth, or, for the higher end of the market, on Youtube, in short videos advertising the property and giving all the necessary information on price as well as the contact of the seller. 

While not illegal in themselves, informal constructions give little rights to their inhabitants when they are pushed out by property developers or by the municipality. Resettled households receive a compensation when they have to move from a neighborhood to a new one. This compensation is rarely enough to afford a new home with the same living standards, says Tai Do, a 37-year-old employee. After he was evicted from his home and forced to relocate to a new neighborhood, he created an association that demands a higher compensation from the government. He says he represents 500 families in the same situation. After his eviction, Tai Do could only afford a new home 25 kilometres from his former neighborhood. This impacted his whole life: “I was always late to work, I had to give up and to find a new job.”. Hahn Le, 65 (the legal retirement age in most of Europe), too underwent a resettlement from the city center to the outskirts of town. She has to commute everyday from her new house to the centre of Ho Chi Minh, where her store is located, on a moped. She says she fears for her life when she slaloms between lorries on the highways of Ho Chi Minh.
