#### Social housing São Paulo: Homeownership in At what cost?

São Paulo is Brazil’s richest city. With 21 million inhabitants, it is the largest metropolis in the Southern hemisphere and twice as large as Paris or London. The cutthroat approach to housing of the past decades, coupled with market deregulation, led to rents doubling in price in the last ten years.

On the open market, the average rent for a one-bedroom dwelling reaches 350€. In Europe, landlords usually ask their renters to earn a monthly revenue at least equal to three times their rent. According to this rule of thumb, a family that earns the minimum wage in São Paulo can pay up to €80 a month, and up to €200 with an average salary. In São Paulo, rents are far higher. For an average earner willing to spend a third of her income in a flat. The Aricanduva district is the only option, more than one hour away from the center using public transports.

The poor suffer most from the housing crisis, as in Europe. With an [average salary](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Sao-Paulo?displayCurrency=EUR) of 2,200 reais (about €600 at the current exchange rate) a month and [minimum wage](http://salariominimo2016.blog.br/) of 880 reais (€250), many cannot afford to rent - least of all to buy - a decent place to live.

Since the 1990’s, the Federal Government launched a range of housing policies to reduce the impact of the crisis. Brazil’s investments in slum-upgrading and public housing rose from 2 billion reais (€550m), in 2002 to 62 billion reais (€24 billion) in 2009.

“The biggest injustice is the rents prices that are so high!” says Anna, a 32-year-old employee in public administration. She is a beneficiary of Brazil’s public housing scheme, Minha Casa Minha Vida. She used to live in a favela, as [one in ten](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favelas_na_cidade_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo) Paulistas still do. In a 20-million megalopolis, this represents 2 million individuals.

The Minha Casa Minha Vida public housing scheme started in 2009, to encourage homeownership. Beneficiaries, earning up to 4,900 reais a month (€1,390), have a facilitated access to credit to buy a house. The poorest receive additional money by the state. In São Paulo alone, the scheme aims to deliver two million homes before 2018.

The state is only financing the construction of the Minha Casa Minha Vida condominiums. Private developers are in charge of providing a plot of land for the newly erected neighborhoods; they are also in charge of the construction. Through the government-owned bank Caixa, the state provides construction guidelines and validates the developers’ projects. This public-private partnership suffers from many deficiencies. Condominiums are isolated, far from public transport and facilities. The Osasco neighborhood, where Anna and 300 other families live, is enclosed between a highway and a wasteland. It can take up to two hours to reach the city center by bus. In many places, residents already reported [maintenance and security](http://www.rioonwatch.org/?p=24874) issues and, in some places, [drug traffickers](http://www.rioonwatch.org/?p=21175) have turned the condominiums into their new strongholds.

Between 2009 and 2013, the construction sector in Brazil [grew by 7% annually](https://www.emis.com/insight/brazils-construction-sector-waning-and-waxing). If the Minha Casa, Minha Vida scheme has been successful to create jobs and to stimulate the construction sector after the 2008 crisis, it is a finger in the dam to counteract the housing crisis in Brazil.
