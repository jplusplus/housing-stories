#### Urban regeneration projects renew central districts and chase the poor

There is a smell of _café latte_ in São Paulo. Like in Mariahilf or Karmeliter in Vienna, Le Marais and Bastille in Paris, or Kreuzberg in Berlin, formerly desolate neighborhoods are attracting the interest of property developers again. 

The Santa Cecília district in the heart of São Paulo exemplifies the gentrification process. The centrally-located neighborhood concentrated economical and political power until the second half of the 20th century and lost steam ever since. 

Santa Cecília was a central enclave for the working-class because of low rent prices - €9 per square meters against €12 or €13 in the nearby Bela Vista and Consolacão. “It was like a village”, says Mario, the retired owner of a restaurant who lived in the neighborhood since his childhood. 
This is about to come to an end. Everywhere in the megacity, rent prices are rising relentlessly. In 2010, they rose by almost 8%.

<small>How to read this chart: A flat that cost €1,000 to rent in Paris in 2004 cost €1,600 in 2015. In São Paulo, a flat that cost 1,000 reais in 2004 now cost 2,200 reais. Note that the data is not corrected for inflation, which was much higher in Brazil than in Europe over the past decade.

#### Gentrification through urban regeneration

Cheap rents and an ideal location attracted the first newcomers - designers or middle-class households - to Santa Cecília. Property developers, too, saw the opportunity.

In the heart of Santa Cecília, the city started a large urban regeneration project in 2014, planned seven years before, Vale do Anhangabaú. An investigation by Repórter Brasil, a group of journalists, [showed](http://privatizacaodarua.reporterbrasil.org.br/?sc=tl/2013-08-02) that, while the €59m project was almost entirely funded by public funds, it was driven in large part by a private bank, Itaú Unibanco.

The Danish architecture studio strongly recommended by Itaú Unibanco advertises the Vale do Anhangabaú as a project [“for the people”](http://gehlpeople.com/cases/sao-paulo-brazil/). A number of public space improvements are planned in the historical centre of São Paulo. The project also includes the construction of 57 shops, restaurants and bars, the construction of a new commercial center and hotel. It is worth noting that construction and real estate companies [donated](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/opinion/vanessa-barbara-brazils-unaffordable-homes.html) more than half the contributions to candidates in the 2012 municipal elections in São Paulo.

Gentrification is not new. At least since the 1960s, rising rents push workers and employees to the outskirts. High-income, well educated dwellers take their place. For all its commitments of building for the people, urban regeneration projects benefit newcomers. Neil Smith, a geographer at City University of New York, [wrote in 2002](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.sci-hub.ac/doi/10.1111/1467-8330.00249/abstract) that “the appeal to bring people back into the city is always a self-interested appeal that the white middle and upper-middle classes retake control of the political and cultural economies as well as the geography of the largest cities.” 

A few succeed in bucking the trend of gentrification. After 15 years of fight, the association Frente de Luta por Moradia (Struggle for Housing Front) obtained from the municipality that Prestes Maia, a high-rise building squatted by 2,000 people in the centre, be converted in a social housing complex. In Paris too, projects like [Clichy-Batignolles](http://www.clichy-batignolles.fr/demain-7-500-habitants-clichy-batignolles), which is half social housing, aims to maintain a less wealthy population in the heart of the city. Such projects, however, are much too small to counteract the gentrification process.
