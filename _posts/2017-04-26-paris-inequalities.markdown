#### Paris is the largest and richest city in the Eurozone and its housing market is fully broken

Paris is one of Europe’s largest cities and, by far, the most populous and richest in the Eurozone. It is also the most unequal. Out of the 10 million inhabitants of the French capital, one in twenty homeowners live under the poverty line. For renters, the ratio jumps to one in four.

Analyzing the housing situation in Paris is not easy to do because, unlike Vienna, Berlin or London, which increased the size of the administrative unit as the city grew, the French capital did not. If anything, Paris became more fragmented over time. As a result, Paris-proper represents only a quarter of the actual metropolis in size and population. For the purpose of this analysis, the area under investigation is the actual city of 10 million, not its central administrative unit. (Just like an analysis of London would have no sense if one were to look only at the City of London, one of the borough of Greater London).

Rents in the French capital are higher than average and wages are, too. The average net monthly wage is about €2,500, a third above the national average. The monthly rent for a one-bedroom flat on the open market is over half this sum, €1,300. A rule of thumb used by landlords and policy-makers alike is that the rent should not be higher than a third of the salary. By this criteria, the average worker in Paris cannot rent anywhere near the center. 

What’s more, these statistics are about averages. A few very high salary can easily skew an average. A normal salary in Paris is closer to €2,000 per month, leaving only €650 for the rent. A €650 rent for a one-bedroom flat can only be found in 9 of the 143 communes of Paris.

The open market being unaffordable for most Parisians, subsidized housing plays a huge role. Eligibility criteria for social housing include the size of the family, poverty, age and other, more opaque factors. For single people under forty, accessing a subsidized apartment is close to impossible. As Maude, a 32-year-old from Bobigny, says, “it can take 15, 20 years, or not work at all”. Singles are not the only ones unable to enter social housing. Mr. Chafai, a father of three, lives with his wife and children in a one-bedroom flat in Bobigny after failing to receive help from the authorities. The situation is so tense that public officials do not hesitate to ask for bribes of several thousand euros to speed up a social housing procedure ([several persons](http://www.lexpress.fr/actualites/1/societe/un-ex-responsable-des-hlm-des-hauts-de-seine-condamne-a-deux-ans-de-prison_1314840.html) were sentenced but the problem is undoubtedly widespread).

Not only is social housing inaccessible for the young, the open market makes it hardest for them to rent. It is [considered]() normal that a small flat be more expensive than a larger one in terms of price per square meter. A one-bedroom apartment might cost € 500per month to rent while a twice-as-big, 3-bedroom one next door might cost €800. The price surcharge for smaller flat is about 20% everywhere. Not in poor Parisian suburbs.

In Paris, the poorer the neighborhood, the higher the price surcharge for smaller flats. In Bobigny, where the poverty rate reaches one in three, one- and two-bedroom flats are 42% more expensive (per square meter) than 3- and 4-bedroom ones. In Le Blanc-Mesnil, the ratio reaches 60%. There, a 40-sqm flat cost about €1,000 per month while an 80-sqm one will cost “only” €1,270.

Even if €270 might seem little for someone who earns €2,500 per month, keep in mind that it represents a quarter of the revenue of a couple living on the poverty line (the couple would earn €1,000 per month).

<small>How to read this scatter plot: The vertical axis shows how more expensive (per square meter) a 1- or 2-bedroom flat is relative to a 3- or 4- bedroom one. The horizontal axis represents the poverty rate. In the city of Bobigny, smaller flats are 40% more expensive and the poverty rate is 36%.  Sources: rentswatch.com, [INSEE - Household incomes and poverty rate in 2013](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2388572)</small>

Market economics teaches us that such a price surcharge could be due to a scarcity of small flats in the poorest areas. This is not the case. The poorest communes of Paris are also the ones where there are the most small flats on offer. In Bobigny, for instance, small flats make up 70% of the total number of flats on offer on the open market. In central Paris, where there are more single professionals and students (people who usually prefer one-bedroom flats), the proportion of small flats on the open market is closer to 50%.

A possible explanation for this seemingly illogical market lies in preference for social housing. Some cities have been shown to favor long-time residents of a commune (read: voters) in the attribution of social housing. The practice is illegal but if this were widespread, or thought to be widespread, renters would have an incentive to rent expensive flats in a commune in the hope of obtaining a subsidized flat in the future.

For Jean-Claude Driant, a professor at the Paris School of Planning, the price surcharge for smaller flats is not surprising. Landlords and tenants do not follow an offer and demand approach to agree on a rent. Rather, there is a generally-accepted rent price for smaller flats and landlords know they do not need to price their smaller flats below this price.   

This analysis shows that, even in the poorest areas of Paris, the poor suffer most from the lack of affordable flats. Direct testimonies and anecdotal evidence from court cases demonstrate that social housing does not support the poor but contributes to increasing inequalities. And we haven’t even touched the issue of racism, which is prevalent both [on the open market](http://www.leparisien.fr/hauts-de-seine/des-agences-immobilieres-soupconnees-de-racisme-06-06-2003-2004146826.php) and in [subsidized housing](http://www.streetpress.com/sujet/1454949104-logement-social-fichage-ethnique). In other words, the housing market in Paris is fully broken and public institutions do not help.
